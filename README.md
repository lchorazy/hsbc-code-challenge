# Networking app

##### To build this app locally:
    ./mvnw install
   
##### To run it:
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    
##### After that you can access API documentation here:
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
    
        

###### Let me know if the solution is incomplete in any way. 
###### For the sake of brevity I have omitted the service layer and made controller call repositories directly
